          Here are some milestones I’ve proudly achieved along my journey in
          technology and AI. Each accomplishment reflects not only technical
          growth but also the dedication, teamwork, and creativity that drive me
          forward. From contributing to my first academic paper presented at
          SoICT 2024, to reaching the final round of the AI Challenge, and
          earning a Certificate of Merit for outstanding research teamwork,
          every step has been a valuable experience that shaped my skills and
          mindset. One of the highlights was securing a Top 7 position out of
          1,800 participants in the SMBC Group GREEN×DATA Challenge 2025
          (Japan), which gave me international exposure and reinforced my
          passion for solving real-world problems with AI. These achievements
          not only strengthen my confidence but also motivate me to continue
          striving for excellence and making meaningful contributions in the
          field of technology.
